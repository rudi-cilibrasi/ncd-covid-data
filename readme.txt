1) The sequences obtained from NCBI and Virus-Host-DB are organized into folders Test1-Test6 (corresponding to the computational experiments in the paper), as fasta files.

2) The accession numbers of the 29 sequences from GISAID (28 COVID-19 virus sequences, and 1 betacoronavirus sequence RaTG13) are provided in the file 'GISAIDsequences.txt'.

3) Users can freely register on GISAID and search for/download the sequences using the provided accession numbers.

4) The RaTG13 sequence should be downloaded and placed in the:
 
a) Coronaviridae folder of Test2
b) Betacoronavirus folder of Test3a and Test3b
c) Sarbecovirus folder of Test4, Test5 and Test6

5) The 28 COVID-19 sequences from GISAID should be downloaded and placed in the COVID19 folder of Test5 and Test6.
